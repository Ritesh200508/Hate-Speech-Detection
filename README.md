# Hate-Speech-Detection
A compact NLP project that detects hate speech in text using a 3-stage preprocessing pipeline, 1 TF-IDF vectorizer, and a machine-learning classifier. The model is trained on labelled comments to identify 2 classes (hate / non-hate) and delivers strong performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
